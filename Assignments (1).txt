  /////////////////////////////          
      8) FOR loop :
      
        --- 8.1) create a method  and in that method iterate the loop for 10 times
        while iteration in the method
            -- if the iteration count value(index position) is even no. then print below stmts
                  My Name is vishnu
                  I am learning Core Java
            -- If the iteration count value is odd no. then print below stmts
                  My name is Uday
                  I am learning core java
            
   ***********************************************************         
            n = 99  // assigning value 0 to varaible n
            no % 2 == 0 // checking whether the result of no/2 is same as 0 or not(whether both are equal or not)
            no % 2 != 0
no/2 and no%2
     9) same above example in while loop and do while loop
     track the iteration values as provided in demo examples\
     
     
Conditional Statements : break, continue, return

   10) Create a loop for values from 1 to 10 and break the loop from 4th even no.
   
   
   11) Create a loop for values from 4 to 13 and break the loop only at 3rd even no 
   Clue : use a local variable to know the count of even no.
   
		   Create a loop for values from 4 to 13 and break the loop only at 2rd odd no 
		   Clue : use a local variable to know the count of even no.
   
   12) Create a method and call this method from main method
        -- create  a loop from 1 to 10
            -- return " I reached value 5" when your iteration count reaches 5
   
   13) create switch case in a method and call this method from another method which would be called from main method
      switch case will take values for weekNo
           Now return week name when specific case gets executed
           
  14) Write a program to find even no. , odd no.,
    and print reverse of a number, and check whether the no. is palendrome no(123) if we reverse(321)
  palendrome -- even we reverse we should get same
        121 --- 121   -- palendrome
        123 --- 321   -- not palendrome         
     create 4 methods and call them independently from main method
     
     122   122 % 2  == 1  or else it is called as even
     123

       // operations are   -- addition, division, multiplication, modulous
       provided a = 2, b = 1, c=2, d=2 
       ( (2+1) * (2/2) ) %2

Name
Sex
Job Title
Organization they work for
Birthday
As for the Organization that the Employee works for, you must also track this information:

Organization Name
Number of Employees

try to identify the common fields and individual fields and based on that you should build the classes and establish the relation between them. 
Note : Fields should be private and we should use getters and setters individually

Task 27 :  *******

Use inheritance to display a student record 

Operation
The user enters a college student's identification number followed by the major and GPA.

The application creates a college student object and displays the object to the screen.


Specifications
First, create a class that defines a student. This class should contain at least two instance variables for identification number and GPA. 
It should also contain two constructors, a default one and one that accepts two values for the instance variables. In addition to set and get methods,
 the class should override the toString method from the Object class.

Next, create a class that defines a college student. To do this, the class should inherit the above class.
 In addition to the inherited instance variables, this class should contain at least one more instance variable 
 that defines the college students major. This class should also contain a default constructor and parameterised constructor 
 one that accepts three values for the instance variables. The first statement in this constructor should call a constructor in the superclass. This class should also override the toString method.

Code a driver class that carries out the operation of the project.

Assume valid data is entered.


Task 28 :

Create a Vehicle class which consists of  numberPlate, licenceNo

Create a Car class which consists of its own properties -- noOfTyres, noOFSeats

Create a Bus class which consists of its own properties -- noOfTyres, noOFSeats
